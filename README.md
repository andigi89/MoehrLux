Arch based distro with Calamares installer KDE Plasma as default desktop

short roadmap
- go free for project as much as possible (gitlab etc.)
- distribute your ISO via google drive (they have good replication over the planet where gitlab and github mostly fails)
- if possible setup a nextcloud where the teams will bring stuffs together (with calendar, chat etc.)
- no rush for creating a website, first months ISO need to pass as much test as possible
- recruit a small beta testing team so they can test build on both bare metal and VM and report issues they face 
- only create telegram group when you get close to release a stable ISO
- because Arch is bleeding edge you don't need to build too much ISO but ship them like every 3 months or so
- better use release date in the naming plus a word if you want or you just keep it release date (i.e 2022.0520)
