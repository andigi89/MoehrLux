# FAQ

1. What's the goal of Moehrlux?

The goal of Moehrlux is provide a stable experience based on the repos of Arch and ArcoLinux. Besides I am going to focus to provide Linux-Zen-Kernel and Btrfs as a rock-solid solution.

The most important aspect starting Moehrlux was that good friends of mine complained that Arch itself doesn't provide a ready-to-go ISO aka big isos for poor countries with laggy internet. In a globalized world we have to re-focus our ressources and our goals to give everybody a chance to be part of the big Linux community!

2. How's the release cycle of Moehrlux isos?

It is planned to publish every 3 month an updated iso.
